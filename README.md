# Assignment 4: Syntax Analyzing/ Parsing

## Section 1: Program to remove left-recursion from grammar G given as input

- This program takes the input grammar and converts it into a form without left recursion. This is essential for proper parsing by a top-down parser.

- Steps to run the program: 

```bash 
cd Section1
g++ qn1.cpp -o qn1
./qn1 input.txt output.txt 
```
## Section 2: Program to take a grammar as input and produce equivalent left-factored grammar as output

- Steps to run the program: 

```bash 
cd Section2
g++ qn2.cpp -o qn2
./qn1 input.txt output.txt 
```

## Section 3: Program to implement a top-down parser
- Steps to run the program: 

```bash 
cd Section2
g++ qn2.cpp -o qn2
./qn1 input.txt output.txt 
```
